These are some of the main features you can look forward to using in secretarAI:
- Email summarization and categorization
  <!-- - Automatically categorize emails into user-created categories
  - Summarize emails at the click of a button -->

  <!-- - Have an AI agent automatically recognize when you haven't been reading certain subscription-based emails very often and suggest that you unsubscribe from them, presenting you with the link to save you the time of finding it in the email -->
- Calendar management
  <!-- - Add generated daily schedules to calendar as calendar events and/or reminders
  - Create new calendar events via voice or text input -->
- To-do list management
  <!-- - Create to-do tasks via voice or text input, and set reminders for them as preferred by user -->
- Schedule generation
  <!-- - Generate schedule for the day by converting calendar events into list of start/stop times and event names; optionally add in to-do items -->
- Legalese summarizer/Agreement Manager
  <!-- - Save time reading privacy policies or terms of use when creating accounts: list out in advance your privacy concerns/preferences or what rights aren't negligible for you, and have the AI agent summarize legalese documents for you with special focus on things that relate to your concerns, preferences, and requirements. -->
- Notes/reminder management
  <!-- - Use voice or text input to make note of things you want to remember, and set reminders for when you want to be shown that information next 
  - Get "nudges" to respond to certain emails if you haven't by a pre-specified date and time
